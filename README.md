## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two main folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `bin`: the compiled output files that are generated by default

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management and Subfolders

There are three subfolders that contain important data/dependencies

- `Apache_POI_Dependencies`: A 3rd party Java API for Microsoft documents
- `Gembox_Dependencies`: A 3rd party tool for editing Excel sheets
- `Database`: This contains all of the Excel files that is used in the program
- `fxml_pages`: This is where all of the fxml files are organized and stored for the program

## How to run on your system

### Step One

The first requirement is to have an IDE:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Apache Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html)
- [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

...to name a few

> Highly recommended to use IntelliJ, and if not then VSCode because they come with JavaFX functionality.

### Step two

Download the program .zip file and unpack it.

### Step three

Open the folder as a project in your IDE of choice (preferably IntelliJ)

### Step 4 (Very Important)

When you have the folder open in your IDE of choice, the first thing you want to do is add the dependencies.

I will, however, only give links for the two preferred IDEs:
- [How to add Dependencies in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-project#_manage-dependencies-for-unmanaged-folder)
- [How to add Dependencies in IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-module-dependencies.html)

There are plenty of guides, forums, and videos to follow for other IDE's, so do not worry if yours isn't listed here.

As for the dependencies that you want to add, there are two you need to add:

1. All of the .jar files in the `Apache_POI_Dependencies` folder
2. The gembox-spreadsheet.jar in the `Gembox_Dependencies` folder

>Make sure that your IDE either comes with JavaFX by default or can support it in order to run the program. If yours doesn't come with it or support it, you will have to switch to one that does.

### Final Step

Run the program and enjoy!
